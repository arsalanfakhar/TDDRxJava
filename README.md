* There is basically just 3 files provided:
    * ```AuthTokenProvider```:     The class that needs to be implemented
    * ```AuthToken```:             A simple data class for the AuthToken
    * ```AuthTokenProviderTest```: The unit tests you should pass


## The rules

* Please do not change ```AuthToken``` or ```AuthTokenProviderTest```!
* Keep the signature of the `AuthTokenProvider` constructor and `AuthTokenProvider.observeToken()` function as they are.
* You should build your implementation within `AuthTokenProvider`. If you need more classes or functions for your implementation, go ahead and create them.
* We pass a few arguments in the ```AuthTokenProvider``` - please make use of them, so that the unit tests have a chance to work.
* ```AuthToken``` has a few helper functions that you might need.
